# Board Game Surfer

*Board Game Surfer* is intended to be an exploratory tool (more specifically, an R Shiny app) that enables the analysis of board games data. 

***I have stopped working on this pet project for now. I am not sure when and if I would return to work on it.***

Some scenarios where it can be useful (eventually):

* Looking up info on a specific board game
* Checking out board games of a specific genre, that support a high-player count or that contain a particular mechanic, and rank them based on user ranking or date of publishing
* Determining what board games to consider next (i.e. recommender system)
* Performing aggregate analyses on trends in board gaming over the years as well as generating reports, plotting charts and exporting stuff.

So far:

* Code for preliminary analysis of [mrpantherson's data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrpantherson/board-game-data) has been added. 
* An R Shiny app has been developed using [mrpantherson's data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrpantherson/board-game-data).
    * The app facilitates viewing of the data and provides simple analyses.
    * Updated the look and feel of the app.
