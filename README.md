# Board Game Surfer

*Board Game Surfer* is an exploratory tool (more specifically, an R Shiny app) that enables the analysis of board games data. To give you ideas on what it is going for, here are some scenarios where it can be useful

* looking up info on a specific board game
* checking out board games of a specific genre, that support a high-player count or that contain a particular mechanic, and rank them based on user ranking or date of publishing
* determining what board games to consider next (i.e. recommender system)
* performing aggregate analyses on trends in board gaming over the years as well as generating reports, plotting charts and exporting stuff.

Nothing has been added yet, but will be soon! 
Stay tuned.
